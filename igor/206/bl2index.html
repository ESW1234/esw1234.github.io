<div id="text"><h1>SAFE LISTENING</h1>
Beats’ signature sound profile is recognized worldwide. Our headphones, earphones and stereos boast the loudest sound, deepest bass, and most impressive sound profile in the industry.

But with great bass comes great responsibility.

LISTEN SAFELY
After placing the headphones on or in your ears, gradually turn up the volume
Use common sense and monitor your listening habits—the lower the volume, the longer you can safely listen to a track.
Don’t use headphones when you’re in a situation that requires full attention, like crossing the street or driving a car.
Exposure to noises over 85 decibels (dB) can result in gradual hearing loss.

iPhone 6s introduces an entirely new way to interact with your phone. For the ﬁrst time, iPhone senses how much pressure you apply to the display. In addition to familiar Multi‑Touch gestures like Tap, Swipe, and Pinch, 3D Touch introduces Peek and Pop. This brings a new dimension of functionality to the iPhone experience. And when you use 3D Touch, your iPhone responds with subtle taps. So not only will you see what a press can do — you’ll feel it.
