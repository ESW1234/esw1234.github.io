SAFE LISTENING
Beatsâ€™ signature sound profile is recognized worldwide. Our headphones, earphones and stereos boast the loudest sound, deepest bass, and most impressive sound profile in the industry. But with great bass comes great responsibility. LISTEN SAFELY After placing the headphones on or in your ears, gradually turn up the volume Use common sense and monitor your listening habitsâ€”the lower the volume, the longer you can safely listen to a track. Donâ€™t use headphones when youâ€™re in a situation that requires full attention, like crossing the street or driving a car. Exposure to noises over 85 decibels (dB) can result in gradual hearing loss. Beatsâ€™ signature sound profile is recognized worldwide.

SOUND TROUBLESHOOTINGâ€“HEADPHONES AND EARPHONES
LOSS OF AUDIO ON ONE SIDE OR DISTORTED SOUND If youâ€™re experiencing snapping, crackling, popping, or no audio on one side, try this: Make sure the 3.5mm audio jack is fully plugged in. The L-shaped input connects to your audio device. The straight input must be completely inserted into your headset. Check that your audio source is on and working. If your audio source is a computer or laptop, try adjusting the configuration settings. If problems persist, try a different audio source or an alternate cable. VOLUME TOO HIGH Turn the source volume down. Yes, itâ€™s really that easy. PHONE NOT RESPONDING TO BUTTON PRESSES Check the headset plug to ensure that it is securely connected. For multi-press functions, vary the speed of presses when using the remote/mic. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES Remember to install the latest software updates on your device. The inline remote/mic may have limited functionality with devices that donâ€™t run iOS. MICROPHONE NOT PICKING UP SOUND Make sure the headset plug is securely connected and that the socket is clean and clear Check that the microphoneâ€”located on the back of the remoteâ€”isnâ€™t blocked or covered Make sure the straight-end of the plug is connected to the headphones and the angled L-shaped plug is connected to the audio source If your issue isnâ€™t listed, or these troubleshooting tips didnâ€™t help, please call Beats Consumer Support to speak with an agent.
