Beats’ signature sound profile is recognized worldwide. Our headphones, earphones and stereos boast the loudest sound, deepest bass, and most impressive sound profile in the industry.

But with great bass comes great responsibility.

LISTEN SAFELY
After placing the headphones on or in your ears, gradually turn up the volume
Use common sense and monitor your listening habits—the lower the volume, the longer you can safely listen to a track.
Don’t use headphones when you’re in a situation that requires full attention, like crossing the street or driving a car.
Exposure to noises over 85 decibels (dB) can result in gradual hearing loss.

iPhone 6s introduces an entirely new way to interact with your phone. For the ﬁrst time, iPhone senses how much pressure you apply to the display. In addition to familiar Multi‑Touch gestures like Tap, Swipe, and Pinch, 3D Touch introduces Peek and Pop. This brings a new dimension of functionality to the iPhone experience. And when you use 3D Touch, your iPhone responds with subtle taps. So not only will you see what a press can do — you’ll feel it.

	<span id ="article3"><h2>SOUND TROUBLESHOOTING–HEADPHONES AND EARPHONES</h2>LOSS OF AUDIO ON ONE SIDE OR DISTORTED SOUND
If you’re experiencing snapping, crackling, popping, or no audio on one side, try this:

Make sure the 3.5mm audio jack is fully plugged in.
The L-shaped input connects to your audio device.
The straight input must be completely inserted into your headset.
Check that your audio source is on and working.
If your audio source is a computer or laptop, try adjusting the configuration settings.
If problems persist, try a different audio source or an alternate cable.


VOLUME TOO HIGH
Turn the source volume down. Yes, it’s really that easy.

PHONE NOT RESPONDING TO BUTTON PRESSES
Check the headset plug to ensure that it is securely connected. For multi-press functions, vary the speed of presses when using the remote/mic.

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
Remember to install the latest software updates on your device. The inline remote/mic may have limited functionality with devices that don’t run iOS.

MICROPHONE NOT PICKING UP SOUND
Make sure the headset plug is securely connected and that the socket is clean and clear
Check that the microphone—located on the back of the remote—isn’t blocked or covered
Make sure the straight-end of the plug is connected to the headphones and the angled L-shaped plug is connected to the audio source
