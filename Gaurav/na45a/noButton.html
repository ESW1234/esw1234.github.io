Portugal Stuns France to Win Euro 2016 Final
Portuguese overcome loss of Cristiano Ronaldo to beat host nation 1-0 on Eder’s extra-time goal
Jul 11, 2016•Fitbit Help

Cristiano Ronaldo spent the biggest moment of his international career in the Portuguese dugout with a sore left knee. Injured nearly two hours earlier, there was nothing he could do in the Euro 2016 final except pace around like a manager wearing shorts.
But in those nervous closing stages of Sunday night’s game, perhaps for the first time in a decade, Portugal didn’t need Ronaldo, its brightest star. With a goal from nowhere in extra time, it defeated host nation France 1-0 to win its first major championship.
“We lost our main man, the man who could score a goal at any moment,” Portugal defender Pepe said of Ronaldo, who left the game in the 25th minute. “But we were warriors on the pitch. We said that we’d win it for him.”

For France, the defeat bordered on unthinkable. Les Bleus had convinced themselves that history was within their grasp at the Stade de France. On the same field where they won the 1998 World Cup, on the home soil where they hadn’t lost any of their previous 18 major-tournament matches, they felt the trophy was theirs for the taking.
